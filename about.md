* I'm kenneth gabriel (@keosariel)
* I grew up and live in Lagos, Nigeria
* I'm studing Statistics as my major at University of Benin, Nigeria
* I'm a Python developer (Backend Dev mainly)
* So here I’d write about my thoughts and ideas, things I’m working on, stuff I’ve read, experiences I’ve had, and definitly talk about python and probably few tutorials and explanations of the inner workings of several softwares and so on.
* Find me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/keosariel) and [Github](http://www.github.com/keosariel)
* I forked the site from [here](https://github.com/andrewhwanpark/dark-poole) and made a few twerks until I was
satisfied.
