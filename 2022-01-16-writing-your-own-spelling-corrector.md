## Writing A Custom Spelling Corrector

Few days back, I had an idea which is to build a search engine for a very popular forum here in Nigeria. Well it's (Nairaland)[https://www.nairaland.com/]. I had downloaded about 1.2 million nairaland webpages and indexed them. Would probably write another post on my journey on building the search engine, but for now I'd focused on the spell checker used.

However, this spelling checker/corrector is just a basic program and would just give you the base understanding and concept of how they work.
