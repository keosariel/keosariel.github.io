You've probably see twitter accounts with a bio containing the author's age i.e 12 year old developer build complex systems in asm x64 and contibuting to linux core. That kind of stuff. They've probably been 12 for like 5 years straight.

However, it's a form of exploitation since people are always amazed at very young people in tech building crazy stuff. But one doesn't need to lie about your age just to chase status. Well, its social media.
