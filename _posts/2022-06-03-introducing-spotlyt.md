[@Spotlyt](https://twitter.com/spotlythq) says "Hello, World".

Spotlyt is a developer first hosted search API platform aiming to simplify building a search infrastructure for anyone be it a lone developer, startup or an enterprise and also deliver amazing search results. You'd literally forget the complexity of search.

We've seen a lot players in the space already, the likes of [elastic search](https://www.elastic.co/), [typesense](https://typesense.org/), and [algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) e.t.c These guys are really go at their suff no doubt and they provide good experience to their secondary consumers.

However, every search platform can give a thousand configurations which can also be replicated by every other search platform, and this is seen as a feature that betters the secondary users (consumers) and might make things hard for the primary users (the developers). Sometimes not only should you be able to explain your idea to a layman but also make you product useable by most people.

You've got a lot of developers, some do hardcore system programming and some write just HTML, CSS and Javascript. In many cases a frontend developer isn't exposed to complex stuffs like you'd see in search. Platforms like [supabase](https://supabase.com/) or [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), these guys have very simple interfaces and configurations and I've basically setup an application without having to go to their docs or google search, and thats the kind of simplicity every developer wants, you'd just know what you want to do before even knowing you want to do it. Developers want to spend more time building their product/project and thats a experience every developer should have.

[@Spotlyt](https://twitter.com/spotlythq) is providing an API platform to give both the developers and consumers an amazing search experience. As even newbies can setup an index for that amazing little "Hello,World" project and provide amazing search experience for any users. The journy won't be easy but we'd be sure to give an amazing experience to everyone.

Wish us luck!

Build faster. Build smarter. Instant API that enables everyone to deliver amazing search results.
