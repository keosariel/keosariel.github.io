title: The future would take care of itself
---
In the past week, I have been collaborating in building some projects and on each project there is this notion of "I'm adding this code just incase..." or "We might need this code later in the future". There is a high probability that you don't need that code, don't make it hard for other people that might want to collaborate, just because you think it'd be needed in the future.

Also, try to make use of conventions not what you think is right (cuz you'd probably be wrong). Like I said don't make it hard for other people to collaborate; do thing that people are familiar with. When things are needed later in the future then you'd have a good reason to write whatever it is, not just writing code base on assumptions. 

The future would take care of itself.
