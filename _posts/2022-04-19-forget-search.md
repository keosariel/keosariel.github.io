title: Forget Search
---
You can be building a web application and totally forget about implementing a good search engine for your app. A frontend dev can build a basic blog using [supabase](https://keosariel.github.io/2021/08/08/supabase-client-python/) or firebase, and don't even know where to start when it's time to implement a search engine. Some would like to use a saas (search as a service) buh the dashboard is so jam packed and they can't even understand the meaning of many search configuration, like you'd see in algolia.

Few months back I hacked together a [search engine](https://github.com/keosariel/nairasearch) and indexed about 1.2 million pages from nairaland, and the search was pretty fast. Well, I'm thinking of building a Saas product that'd make it easy for even beginner devs to setup a search engine for their site.

But currently I'm syked about web3 and I just hope I'd be able to implement the mvp in no time.
