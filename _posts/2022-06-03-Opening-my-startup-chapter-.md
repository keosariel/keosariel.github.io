Well, it's been a while since I had this Idea on building a developer first experience hosted search platform. It's been on my mind for months, I've been going back and forth with the idea, since it's a problem I often come across.

Few months ago, I built a [simple search engine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220227120120/https://www.nairasearch.xyz/) that indexed about 1.2 million pages of nairaland and the query was pretty fast, as in instant search fast. I saw more like a means to implement search cheaply and would only require expenses as you scale.

Beside, I've been looking for a Job for a while now and I've gotten nothing, not even an internship, LOL. However, it's worth the time to work on your own stuff, your own problem and as a developer we often come across other developers with the same problem. So all I've got is hope, faith, and a little cash to bootstrap the startup for like 2 months LOL.

Wish me luck :)
