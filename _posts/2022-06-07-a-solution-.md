It's the everyday trend and excitement, It's what very few really understand and many just follow the crowd, It's the space that'd probably take over the world, It's Web3.

Everyone, is excited about web3. Maybe not everyone but you've got controversy everyday. You've got a lot of players in web3, and lot of people still want to participate. It's obvious that there are startups that just look for good web2 solutions and port them to web3, some build original products solving real world problem, some building bot and some stealing assets.

Web3 provides a great solution that can be applicable in a lot of areas especially the financial sector. However, since everyone wants to participate in web3, it's becomes a solution in search for a problem. People tend to follow trends and once the dust settles the real innovation still stands. Once a new technology is hot, everyone wants to participate one way or the other, sometimes to attract investors because some investors follow trends too.

Innovation is innovaition regardless of the tech used to solve any problem. Lets solve crazy problems because we have problems, not looking for problem because we have solutions.
