Few weeks back, I came across [this tweet](https://twitter.com/alexlobaloba/status/1570377125840158721?s=20&t=FmxL9KCuL32yTWdRv_yxrg) and the point it's trying to make is "the more you voice out your plans the less likely they'd happen". I have experienced such several times and thought I was the only one with this problem (maybe it's not a problem). It happened that a lot of people have this same issue of keeping certain things secret, and even sometimes when they decide to keep things secret they unconsciously say it to certain people and then have regrets.

From my experience, I feel there is a form of energy that comes from different people (bad and good energy); Be it friends or family, I think letting some people know certain things alters their plans and this change of plan alters yours some way some how as long as it doesn't increase the probability of you attaining whatever you planned.

Don't take this too seriously, it's just a thought I needed to put out in words.
