The Idea

Well, I and a team of about 25 people from twitter were having a discussion (not all were in the meeting tho) on what idea to work on. We spoke for hours touching many sectors in tech i.e fintech, health tech and edutech for starters.
A lot of us are very new to working with a team and executing an idea in a given time frame. 

You’d be surprise how easy people come up with ideas. Buh here’s the issue validating every idea as a team. 

From what I’ve learnt in the past, I know every idea should have a good solution to a problem, tho the solution doesn’t need to be efficient for starters. You can tell that from several startups that got better and better with time (sorry I don’t really have good references at the moment).

However, during the meeting I stated that “we all don’t center all our ideas to the three sectors I mentioned earlier” and this is because we have a lot of new technology trends and it just doesn’t seem right to neglect what has been. 

E-commerce has one of the largest market place and however majority of the top companies aren’t even in fintech, health tech and Edutech (my opinion).

So my point is when coming up with ideas we shouldn’t just restrict them to the trends Buh look more on good problems. We really don’t want to have a solution and then looking for a problem to pair it with.

These are my opinion and maybe a lot might be wrong, which means there is always room for correction.
