title: The Harmonic Meetup

I had a very good experience in the harmony one meetup in benin, Nigeria in summary :)

Well, there was a lot of presentations and all were focused on web3 and the blockchain. I learnt a lot from the meetup as usual and now I have a very good interest in web3 and would probably start my journey ASAP. 

I’d probably blog about my journey right here, you can always check back if you’d be interested.

However, I feel this blockchain tech is a fad and it’s just a means to an end. I think the main disruptions would be in web4 probably cuz a lot of expensive mistakes would be made in web3. Would elaborate more on this topic in my later articles.
