Sincerely, I've forgotten you guys and also forgot to tell you my birthday was yesterday. Even if I know no one reads this, I still feel the need to let myself or anyone that might read it later know how my birthday went.

Like every birthday, I'd probabaly get a lot of text from friends and family, same praying for me and some wishing me happy birtday. When I woke up replied alot of text and prayed. However, for some reason my mom decided to narrate my giving birth story and It was really toucing, I almost cried :) buh I'm 20 now crying is for kids LOL.

Most of my day was spent with my family, cousins and aunts. I don't believe in the notion having to go out and flex, would only do that if the whole family is going with or that's the only means to celebrate at that point. I ate a lot of cakes, as in CAKESSSSSS, pardon my emphasis. I really enjoyed it and it'd be worth it going back in time to re-experience it again. It couldn't have been better!! 

Now, I am 20 I'm grown and still growing and a lot of habits needs to be left behind and I really need to focus and improve in anyway I can. Cheers to my new age (emoji with beers)(:love).
